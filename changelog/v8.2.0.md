# 8.2.0

The 8.2 release includes fixes for a few bugs in the 8.1 release and a couple new enhancements, including new WebGL features and support for `ol/render/Feature` for vector layers.  Nothing special is required when upgrading from 8.1. Only TypeScript users might have to make minor changes, because some types have been made more strict.
