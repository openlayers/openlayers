# 10.7.1

The 10.7 release brings new sources: `OGCMap` for OGC API Maps, and an experimental `GeoZarr` source for raster data conforming to the evolving GeoZarr specification.
Vector rendering also gets an important new features: finally, we can offset lines. And we have added support for `ReferrerPolicy` when fetching source data and icons, which may become important because OpenStreetMap already started demanding a referer header when serving tiles. To round up the release, many bugs were fixed, and memory management for image styles was improved.
