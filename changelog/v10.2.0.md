# 10.2.0

The 10.2 release adds an experimental `Flow` layer to render particle flows (e.g. wind) in WebGL, support for WMS Capabilities v1.1.1, and an `ol.VERSION` property in the legacy build. Under the hood, it brings several performance improvements, better memory management, bug fixes, type improvements, and the removal of unnecessary tile caching code.
