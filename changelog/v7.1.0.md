# 7.1.0

The 7.1 release adds a handful of new features and updates the story for users of the full library build.

#### Draw with tracing

The draw interaction has a new `trace` option.  When this is set, you can click on existing features to trace their outlines while creating new polygons or lines.

#### New GeoTIFF options

The GeoTIFF source now supports imagery with internal masks.  In addition, the GeoTIFF source accepts a `convertToRGB: 'auto'` setting.  With this new setting, the values will be converted to RGB in cases where the input data has three bands and the photometric interpretation is one of CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab.

#### Notice to full build users

If you have been using the full build of the library, we now include this full build in the release package.  This should mean stable URLs that you can point to in a `<script>` tag.  See the https://openlayers.org/download/ page for more detail.

#### Deprecation of `ol/AssertionError` and error codes

Future versions will no longer throw `ol/AssertionError` with an error `code`. Instead, they will throw `Error` with just the error message.

#### Updating parameters in `ol/source/ImageWMS` and `ol/source/TileWMS`

The `updateParams()` method is the only way to update WMS parameters. Changes made directly to the `params` object passed as a constructor option will have no effect.
