# 10.0.0

The 10.0 release brings several significant improvements, including a new base source for image tile sources with improved performance and simplified code. Flat styles handling has been reworked, removing the need to specify type hints among other internal improvements. In the WebGL renderer, a memory allocation issue has been fixed. For better developer experience, we improved generic types and fixed some issues with types, stabilizing the back and forth on generics in v9.x.

Breaking changes are very minor, so we recommend upgrading to v10.x for all v9.x users.

#### Backwards incompatible changes

##### `ol/source/VectorTile`: `getFeaturesInExtent()` method moved to `ol/layer/VectorTile`

The `getFeaturesInExtent()` method of `ol/source/VectorTile` has been moved to `ol/layer/VectorTile`. The signature and behavior have not changed, so all that needs to be done is change code from e.g.
```js
layer.getSource().getFeaturesInExtent(extent);
```
to
```js
layer.getFeaturesInExtent(extent);
```

##### Flat styles: Removal of Type hints in `'get'` expressions

For the Canvas renderer, additional arguments to the `'get'` call expression now mean access to nested properties or array items. The expression system has been improved so type hints are no longer needed. If you were previously using a type hint in a `get` expression, you have to change the expression from e.g.
```js
['get', 'foo', 'number[]']
```
to
```js
['get', 'foo']
```

#### Other changes

##### Removal of the `opaque` option from all `Tile` sources

The `opaque` option was previously used to hint the renderer to perform some optimizations on layers known to be fully opaque. This is no longer needed, and the option has been removed.
