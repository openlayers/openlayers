# 10.7.0

With 40 pull requests over a period of almost 5 months, this long awaited release brings important bug fixes as well as exiting new features. The highlights are

* Several WebGL renderer bug fixes, along with improved memory management
* Updates for the Polyline feature format
* API improvements and bug fixes on the Select, Extent and Snap interactions
* Full web worker support for `Map`, with an (Offscreen)Canvas as map target
* Fixed cache and rendering for reprojected raster/image tile layers
* Several updated and new examples, including a globe-like map with Equal Earth projection

### Upgrade notes

#### Deprecation of ol/array's stableSort

Sorting is guaranteed to be stable since [ECMAScript 2019](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-UseUS/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#sort_stability).
```js
// Before
stableSort(arr, compareFnc);
```
```js
// After
arr.sort(compareFnc);
```

#### Deprecation of functions in ol/format/Polyline

The following functions have been deprecated without replacement:
- decodeDeltas
- encodeDeltas
- decodeFloats
- encodeFloats
