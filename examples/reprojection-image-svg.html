title: SVG Image Reprojection
shortdesc: Demonstrates client-side reprojection of single SVG image source.
docs: >
  This example shows client-side reprojection of a single SVG image source.
  When using the `ol/source/Image.svgLoad()` function SVG images will scale during
  zooming.  Compared to the [Image Reprojection](reprojection-image.html) example
  on most browsers there is minimal blurring (or pixelation if interpolation is
  disabled) when zooming in.  Due to performance issues a lower quality rasterized
  fallback will be seen on Firefox.
