title: Reusable Source
shortdesc: Updating a tile source by changing the URL.
docs: >
  You can call <code>source.setUrl()</code> to update the URL for a tile source.  Note that when you change the URL for a tile source, existing tiles will not be replaced until new tiles are loaded.  If you are interested instead in clearing currently rendered tiles, you can call the <code>source.refresh()</code> method.  Alternatively, you can use two separate sources if you want to remove rendered tiles and start over loading new tiles.
