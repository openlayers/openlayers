title: Populated Places
shortdesc: Scaling and coloring points according to population.
docs: >
  The populated places dataset has a `pop_max` field that is used in rendering the style for each place.
  The `interpolate` operator is used to scale the `circle-radius`, rendering a point with a radius of 3
  for places with a population under 500 thousand, growing to a point with a radius of 10 for places with
  a population of 10 million or more.  The same `interpolate` operator is used to generate a color ramp
  for places based on the same `pop_max` field.
