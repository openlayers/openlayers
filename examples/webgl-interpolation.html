title: Interpolating Contours from a DEM
shortdesc: Example of WebGL data interpolation
docs: >
  <p>
    Example of data resampling when using raster DEM (digital elevation model) data with WebGL.
    The data is interpolated by calculating the values represented by the RGB bands of the pixels and the
    interpolated values are styled back as RGB so they can be accessed by a <code>ol/source/Raster</code>.
    One raster source is used to plot contours where adjacent interpolated pixels cross the contour interval.
    A second unseen raster source allows a custom mouse position control to display interpolated elevations
    obtained from the rendered pixels.
  </p><p>
    The DEM source has a maximum zoom level of 14 while the view and background layer can zoom in much further.
    The data values of the original source are shown for comparison.  Notice how, particularly on steep ground,
    the interpolated values and contours change smoothly while the original data values are stepped.
