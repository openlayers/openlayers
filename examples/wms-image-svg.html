title: WMS loader with SVG format
shortdesc: Using the WMS loader to use SVG images with an Image source.
docs: >
  The Image source can be configured with service specific loaders. By default, the loader returns the image
  as decoded `ImageBitmap`. When using the `ol/source/Image.load()` function instead, SVG images will scale during
  zooming, because they will be used as `HTMLImageElement` directly instead of an `ImageBitmap`.
