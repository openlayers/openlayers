title: GeoZarr Resampling
shortdesc: A GeoZarr source displaying Sentinel-2 imagery with resampling.
docs: >
  The GeoZarr dataset used in this example doesn't have all bands available at all zoom levels. When
  this is the case, band data from the nearest resolution level will be resampled in composing a
  data tile. The example shows a false-color composite composed of blue (`b02`), green (`b03`), and
  short-wave infrared (`b11`) data. The short-wave infrared data is only available to 20 m
  resolution. The visible blue and green bands are available at 10 m resolution. When the map is
  zoomed in beyond 20 meters per pixel, the highest resolution short-wave infrared data is fetched,
  resampled, and composed together with the higher resolution visible bands.
