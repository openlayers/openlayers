title: Vector Tile Selection
shortdesc: Select features from vector tiles.
docs: >
  <p>
    Click a rendered vector-tile feature to highlight it on the map. Click on an empty spot (ocean) to reset the selection.
    By changing the action type to "Multi Select" you can select multiple features at a time. With "Single Select on hover",
    features will be higlighted when the pointer is above them.
  </p><p>
    The selection layer is configured with <code>renderMode: 'vector'</code> for better performance on frequent redraws,
    i.e. when "Single Select on hover" is selected.
