  Example of using the drag-and-drop interaction with a custom format to handle KMZ files.
  In addition to the formats used in the [Drag-and-Drop](drag-and-drop.html) example a custom format (subclassing KML) is used to handle KMZ files.
  KML and icons must be extracted from the KMZ array buffer synchronously.
  There is no projection transform support, so this will only work with data in EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857.
