title: Vector Labels - Justify Text
shortdesc: Example of text justification within a label.
docs: >
  This example showcases how the text can be justified within the label box.
  By default, the text is justified according to the `textAlign` option.
  However, this option justifies also the label itself according to `textAlign` setting.
  To decouple the label placement from text placement (within the label box) use `justify`.
