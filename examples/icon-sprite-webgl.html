title: Icon Sprites with WebGL
shortdesc: Rendering many icons with WebGL
docs: >
  This example shows how to use `ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer` to render
    a very large amount of sprites. The above map is based on a dataset from the National UFO Reporting Center: each
    icon marks a UFO sighting according to its reported shape (disk, light, fireball...). The older the sighting, the redder
    the icon.

  A very simple sprite atlas is used in the form of a PNG file containing all icons on a grid. Then, the `texCoordCallback`
    option of the `ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer` constructor is used to specify which sprite to use according to the sighting shape.

  The dataset contains around 80k points and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
