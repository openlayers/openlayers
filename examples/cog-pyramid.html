title: GeoTIFF tile pyramid
shortdesc: Rendering a COG tile pyramid as layer group.
docs: >
  Data from a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) tile pyramid can be rendered as a set of layers.  In this
  example, a pyramid of 3-band GeoTIFFs is used to render RGB data. For each tile of the pyramid, a
  separate layer is created on demand. The lowest resolution layer serves as preview while higher resolutions are
  loading.
