title: GeoTIFF tile pyramid
shortdesc: Rendering a COG tile pyramid as layer group.
docs: >
  Data from a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) tile pyramid can be rendered as a set of layers.  In this
  example, a pyramid of 3-band GeoTIFFs is used to render RGB data. The `ol/source.sourcesFromTileGrid`
  helper function creates sources from this pyramid on demand. The GeoTIFFs used by those sources have
  a resolution range that matches the range of a single z of the pyramid tile grid.
