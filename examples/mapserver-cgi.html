shortdesc: Example of a MapServer CGI map.
docs: >
  Example of a map generated using the MapServer [CGI Controls](https://mapserver.org/cgi/controls.html).
  The CGI interface allows testing a Mapfile without having to configure WMS services. The Mapfile
  used in this example can be seen [here](https://demo.mapserver.org/itasca_legend/itasca3.txt).

  It is **strongly** recommended to configure MapServer to serve WMS and use the OpenLayers
  [WMS loader](mapserver-wms.html), rather than this older CGI approach.
