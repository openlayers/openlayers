title: Vector tiles reprojected

shortdesc: Example showing vector tiles in EPSG:4326, reprojected to a polar projection.
docs: >
  Vector tile layers can be reprojected to other projections. This example shows vector tiles in geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326) reprojected to North Pole Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ESRI:102017).
  For polar regions, vector tiles in geographic coordinates are recommended, because Web Mercator tiles do not work beyond 85° North and South.
