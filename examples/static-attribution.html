title: Static Attribution
shortdesc: Example of an attributions control with a static attribution
docs: >
  This example shows how to add an attribution that never disappears from the map. 
  It works by passing a static string or HTML string into the attribution options, which is not linked to the layers. 
  Click the 'Toggle layer' button to show that, even with no layers on, the static attribution remains on screen.
