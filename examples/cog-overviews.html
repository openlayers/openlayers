title: GeoTIFF with Overviews
shortdesc: Rendering a GeoTIFF with external overviews as a layer.
docs: >
  In some cases, a GeoTIFF may have external overviews.  This example uses the
  `overviews` property to provide URLs for the external overviews.  The example
  composes a false color composite using shortwave infrared (B6), near infrared (B5),
  and visible green (B3) bands from a Landsat 8 image.
