title: GeoTIFF with Overviews
shortdesc: Rendering a GeoTIFF with external overviews as a layer.
docs: >
  In some cases, a GeoTIFF may have external overviews.  This example uses the
  `overviews` property to provide URLs for the external overviews.  The example
  composes regions of the Netherlands with three sub-regions used for historical
  land use research.  External overviews provide the first three zoom levels.
