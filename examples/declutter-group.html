title: Declutter Group
shortdesc: Group decluttering of vector symbols and text.
docs: >
  Different truthy `declutter` values enable declutter groups. If `declutter` was set to `true` on the
  vector layer in this example, the symbol and texts of the vector layer would prevent overlapping
  symbols and texts from the Mapbox styled layers below. Because it is set to `"separate"`, which is
  a different value than `true`, the vector layer is decluttered separate from the Mapbox styled
  layers below. Symbols and texts of the Mapbox styled layers below can overlap those of the vector
  layer.
