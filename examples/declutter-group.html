title: Declutter Group
shortdesc: Declutter vector layers by groups
docs: >
  This shows how to specify the frequency that vector(tile) layers are decluttered if declutter is set to true. If not 
  specified, it will default to only one group and decluttering will overlay all layers. When specified, 
  decluttering will occur before the layer is rendered every time `startDeclutterGroup` is set to `true`. This is useful 
  for layers that need to be remain above the declutter effort of lower layers. In the example, the blue square displays
  over the decluttered vector layer labels.
