shortdesc: Example using the hitTolerance parameter.
docs: >
  By default, the map.forEachFeatureAtPixel() function only considers features that are directly under the provided
  pixel. This can make it difficult to interact with features on touch devices. To consider features within some
  distance of the provided pixel, use the hitTolerance option. For example,
  map.forEachFeatureAtPixel(pixel, callback, {hitTolerance: 3}) will call the callback with all features that are
  within three pixels of the provided pixel.
