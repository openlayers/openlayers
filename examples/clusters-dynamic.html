title: Dynamic clusters
shortdesc: Clusters with zoom-to-cluster, hull view, and uncluttering of overlapping features.
docs: >
  <p>This example shows open data of subsidized photovoltaic installations in Vienna. Different style functions
    are used for cluster display, single feature display, convex hull of a cluster, and an expanded view of
    overlapping features. Hovering over a cluster shows its convex hull. Clicking on a cluster zooms to the
    extent of the contained features. Clicking on a cluster consisting of features that are very close to each other reveals an expanded view
    of the features, along a circle around the cluster.</p>
  <p>Features are styled differently depending on the power of the photovoltaic installation.</p>
