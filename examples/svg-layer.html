title: SVG Layer
shortdesc: Example of a map with an interactive svg layer.
docs: >
  With a plain `ol/Layer` and a `render` function, we can use an interactive svg as layer. Hover over countries to see the interactivity that is defined purely with a css `:hover` pseudo-class.
  Other layers can be added to the same map. The blue circle is a vector feature on a separate layer.
