title: NDVI from a Sentinel 2 COG
shortdesc: Calculating NDVI and applying a custom color map.
docs: >
  The GeoTIFF layer in this example draws from two Sentinel 2 sources: a red band and a near infrared band.
  The layer style includes a `color` expression that calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
  from values in the two bands.  The `interpolate` expression is used to map NDVI values to colors.
