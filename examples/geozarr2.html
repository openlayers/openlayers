shortdesc: A GeoZarr source displaying Sentinel-2 imagery.
docs: >
  The GeoZarr source can be used to read groups of multi-band data from Zarr files following the [GeoZarr specification](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec).
  In this example, a true-color composite is rendered from Sentinel-2 L2A bands B02 (blue), B03 (green), and B04 (red) reflectance values.
  Reflectance values from 0 to 0.5 are stretched to values between 0 and 255 for the RGB color channels; and values that are all zero are
  made transparent (with 0 in the alpha channel). A gamma correction is also made to brighten the image.
