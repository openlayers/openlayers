title: WebGL Tile Transitions
shortdesc: Example of smooth tile transitions when changing the dimension of a WebGL layer.
docs: >
  Demonstrates smooth reloading of layers when changing a dimension continuously. The reason this example exists is to show this feature working with the WebGL based renderer as compared to the default canvas based renderer shown in <a href="/en/latest/examples/wmts-dimensions.html">the WMTS Tile Transitions example</a>. The demonstration layer is a global sea-level computation (flooding computation from <a href="https://scalgo.com/">SCALGO</a>, underlying data from <a href="https://cgiarcsi.community/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1">CGIAR-CSI SRTM</a>) where cells that are flooded if the sea-level rises to more than <em>x</em> m are colored blue. The user selects the sea-level dimension using a slider.
