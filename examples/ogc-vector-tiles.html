title: OGC Vector Tiles
shortdesc: Rendering vector tiles from an OGC API – Tiles service.
docs: >
  The <a href="https://ogcapi.ogc.org/tiles/">OGC API – Tiles</a> specification describes how a service can provide vector tiles.  Because the specification
  has not yet been finalized, the <code>OGCVectorTile</code> source is not yet part of the stable API.
