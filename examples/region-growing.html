title: Region Growing
shortdesc: Grow a region from a seed pixel
docs: >
  <p>Click a region on the map. The computed region will be red.</p>
  <p>
    This example uses a <code>ol.source.Raster</code> to generate data
    based on another source.  The raster source accepts any number of
    input sources (tile or image based) and runs a pipeline of
    operations on the input data.  The return from the final
    operation is used as the data for the output source.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, a single tiled source of imagery data is used as input.
    The region is calculated in a single "image" operation using the "seed"
    pixel provided by the user clicking on the map. The "threshold" value
    determines whether a given contiguous pixel belongs to the "region" - the
    difference between a candidate pixel's RGB values and the seed values must
    be below the threshold.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example also shows how an additional function can be made available
    to the operation.
