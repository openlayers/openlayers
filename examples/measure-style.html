title: Measure using vector styles
shortdesc: Example of measuring lengths and areas using vector styles.
docs: >
  <p>Using vector styles instead of overlays makes it easy to set up, then modify and
  clear a measure.  Additional information such as the lengths of individual segments
  or sides can be included as required.</p>
  <p>The <code>getLength()</code> and <code>getArea()</code>
  functions calculate spherical lengths and areas for geometries.  Lengths are
  calculated by assuming great circle segments between geometry coordinates.
  Areas are calculated as if edges of polygons were great circle segments.</p>
  <p>Note that the <code>geometry.getLength()</code> and <code>geometry.getArea()</code>
  methods return measures of projected (planar) geometries.  These can be very
  different than on-the-ground measures in certain situations â€” in northern
  and southern latitudes using Web Mercator for example.  For better results,
  use the functions in the <code>ol/sphere</code> module.</p>
