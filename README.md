# OpenLayers

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is a high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source on any web page. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

## Getting Started

Install the [`ol` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol):

```
npm install ol
```

Import just what you need for your application:

```js
import Map from 'ol/Map';
import View from 'ol/View';
import TileLayer from 'ol/layer/Tile';
import XYZ from 'ol/source/XYZ';

new Map({
  target: 'map',
  layers: [
    new TileLayer({
      source: new XYZ({
        url: 'https://{a-c}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
      })
    })
  ],
  view: new View({
    center: [0, 0],
    zoom: 2
  })
});
```

See the following examples for more detail on bundling OpenLayers with your application:

 * Using [Vite](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-vite)
 * Using [Rollup](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-rollup)
 * Using [webpack](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-webpack)
 * Using [Parcel](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-parcel)

## ES Modules

The `ol` package contains a `src/` folder with the sources, authored as [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). To use these untranspiled sources, either import modules from `ol/src` instead of `ol`, or configure your bundler with an alias pointing to `ol/src` for the `ol` package.

## TypeScript support

The [ol package](https://npmjs.com/package/ol) includes auto-generated TypeScript declarations as `*.d.ts` files.

## Supported Browsers

OpenLayers runs on all modern browsers that support [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [ECMAScript 5](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/). This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.

For older browsers and platforms (Internet Explorer, Android 4.x, iOS v12 and older, Safari v12 and older), polyfills may be needed for the following browser features:

* [`fetch`](https://caniuse.com/fetch): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/).
* [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/).
* [`element.prototype.classList` (`add`/`remove`)](https://caniuse.com/classlist): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/).
* [`URL` API](https://caniuse.com/url): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) or [core-js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/core-js/).
* [`TextDecoder`](https://caniuse.com/textencoder): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/).
* [`Number.isInteger`](https://caniuse.com/isInteger): Available from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) or [core-js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/core-js/).
* [`Reflect`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_reflect): Available from [core-js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/core-js/).
* [Pointer events](https://caniuse.com/pointer): Use [elm-pep](https://npmjs.com/package/elm-pep) (lightweight) or [pepjs](https://npmjs.com/package/pepjs) (for really, really old browsers).

[`ol/source/GeoTIFF`](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_source_GeoTIFF-GeoTIFFSource.html) requires a browser that supports [ECMAScript 6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/). Additionally a polyfill for [`Promise.allSettled`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_promise_allsettled) may be needed.
