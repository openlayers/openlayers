# OpenLayers

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is a high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source on any web page. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

## Getting Started

Install the [`ol` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol):

```
npm install ol
```

Import just what you need for your application:

```js
import Map from 'ol/Map';
import View from 'ol/View';
import TileLayer from 'ol/layer/Tile';
import XYZ from 'ol/source/XYZ';

new Map({
  target: 'map',
  layers: [
    new TileLayer({
      source: new XYZ({
        url: 'https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
      })
    })
  ],
  view: new View({
    center: [0, 0],
    zoom: 2
  })
});
```

See the following examples for more detail on bundling OpenLayers with your application:

 * Using [Vite](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-vite)
 * Using [Rollup](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-rollup)
 * Using [webpack](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-webpack)
 * Using [Parcel](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-parcel)

For more detail on quick prototyping without the use of a Node.js based setup, see the [Skypack](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-skypack) example.

## Supported Browsers

OpenLayers runs on all modern browsers (with greater than 1% global usage).  This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. For older browsers, [polyfills](https://polyfill.io/) will likely need to be added.
