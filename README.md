[OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org/) is a high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source on any web page. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD).

## Getting Started

- Download the [latest release](http://openlayers.org/download/)
- Install with npm: `npm install openlayers`
- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:openlayers/ol3.git`

## Supported Browsers

OpenLayers runs on all modern browsers that support [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [ECMAScript 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/). This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. For older browsers and platforms like Internet Explorer (down to version 9) and Android 4.x, [polyfills](http://polyfill.io) for `requestAnimationFrame` and `Element.prototype.classList` are required, and using the KML format requires a polyfill for `URL`.
