     *
     * Listeners will be called with a reference to an event object.  The

     *
     * All event objects have at least the following properties:
     * object - {Object} A reference to map.events.object.
     * element - {DOMElement} A reference to map.events.element.

     * Browser events have the following additional properties:
     * xy - {<OpenLayers.Pixel>} The pixel location of the event (relative
     *     to the the map viewport).
     *
     * Supported map event types:
     * preaddlayer - triggered before a layer has been added.  The event
     *     object will include a *layer* property that references the layer  
     *     to be added. When a listener returns "false" the adding will be 
     *     aborted.
     * addlayer - triggered after a layer has been added.  The event object
     *     will include a *layer* property that references the added layer.
     * preremovelayer - triggered before a layer has been removed. The event
     *     object will include a *layer* property that references the layer  
     *     to be removed. When a listener returns "false" the removal will be 
     *     aborted.
     * removelayer - triggered after a layer has been removed.  The event
     *     object will include a *layer* property that references the removed
     *     layer.
     * changelayer - triggered after a layer name change, order change,
     *     opacity change, params change, visibility change (due to resolution
     *     thresholds) or attribution change (due to extent change). Listeners
     *     will receive an event object with *layer* and *property* properties.
     *     The *layer* property will be a reference to the changed layer. The
     *     *property* property will be a key to the changed property (name,
     *     order, opacity, params, visibility or attribution).
     * movestart - triggered after the start of a drag, pan, or zoom
     * move - triggered after each drag, pan, or zoom
     * moveend - triggered after a drag, pan, or zoom completes
     * zoomend - triggered after a zoom completes

     * APIMethod: removeLayer
     * Removes a layer from the map by removing its visual element (the 
     *   layer.div property), then removing it from the map's internal list 
     *   of layers, setting the layer's map property to null. 
     * 
     *   a "removelayer" event is triggered.
     * 
     *   very worthy of mention is that simply removing a layer from a map
     *   will not cause the removal of any popups which may have been created
     *   by the layer. this is due to the fact that it was decided at some
     *   point that popups would not belong to layers. thus there is no way 
     *   for us to know here to which layer the popup belongs.
     *    
     *     A simple solution to this is simply to call destroy() on the layer.
     *     the default OpenLayers.Layer class's destroy() function
     *     automatically takes care to remove itself from whatever map it has
     *     been attached to. 
     * 
     *     The correct solution is for the layer itself to register an 
     *     event-handler on "removelayer" and when it is called, if it 
     *     recognizes itself as the layer being removed, then it cycles through
     *     its own personal list of popups, removing them from the map.

     * setNewBaseLayer - {Boolean} Default is true
