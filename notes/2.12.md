# Behavior Changes from Past Releases

## Function return values

[Previously][prev] a few functions in the library displayed error messages and returned `undefined`, `null` or `false` if the parameters passed in were bad. In 2.12 these functions now just throw an error/exception. People relying on return values to know if a function call is successful may need to change their code. Here are the modified functions:

 * `OpenLayers.Bounds.add` throws a `TypeError` exception if `x` or `y` is null
 * `OpenLayers.LonLat.add` throws a `TypeError` exception if `lon` or `lat` is null
 * `OpenLayers.Pixel.add` throws a `TypeError` exception if `x` or `y` is null
 * `OpenLayers.Filter.Comparison.value2regex` throws an `Error` exception if `wildcard` equals to `"."`
 * `OpenLayers.Layer.PointTrack.addNodes` throws a `TypeError` exception if `endPoint` isn't actually a point
 * `OpenLayers.Layer.Vector.getFeatureFromEvent` throws an `Error` exception if the layer has no renderer

## Changes in formats WMTSCapabilities and SOSCapabilities

The structure of the object returned by `Format.WMTSCapabilities:read` and `Format.SOSCapabilities:read` has slightly changed.

For `WMTSCapabilities` the GET href used to be made available at `operationsMetadata.GetCapabilities.dcp.http.get`, the latter is now an array of objects with two properties: `url` and `constrains`. People using `operationsMetadata.GetCapabilities.dcp.http.get` in their applications should certainly use `operationsMetadata.GetCapabilities.dcp.http.get[0].url`.

Likewise for `SOSCapabilities`.

Looking at the tests is a good way to understand what the requires changes are. See [SOSCapabilities/v1_0_0.html](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/tests/Format/SOSCapabilities/v1_0_0.html) and [WMTSCapabilities/v1_0_0.html](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/tests/Format/WMTSCapabilities/v1_0_0.html).

## Rico deprecation

We are deprecating the Rico classes/objects in OpenLayers. This has the following implications:

`Popup.AnchoredBubble` is deprecated. Its constructor now displays a deprecation message on the console. If you want popups with rounded corners either use `Popup.FramedClould`, or use `Popup.Anchored` and round corners using the [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/border-radius) CSS property.

The `roundedCorner` option of `Control.LayerSwitcher` is deprecated, and it now defaults to `false`. Setting it to true results in deprecation messages being output on the console. If you still want to set `roundedCorner` to `true` (you should not!) you need to make sure that the Rico/Corner.js and Rico/Color.js scripts are loaded in the page. This can be ensured by adding Rico/Corner.js in the build profile. The controls.html example demonstrates how to use `border-radius` to round corners of a layer switcher:


    olControlLayerSwitcher .layersDiv {
        border-radius: 10px 0 0 10px;
    }

See more detail in the Rico deprecation [pull request](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/99).

In future releases we intend to move the Rico and `AnchoredBubble` code into deprecated.js. You really should consider stop using Rico-based functionalities in your applications.
