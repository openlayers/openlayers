  Usage: ${1} <version> [options]

  To publish a new release, update the version number in package.json and
  create a tag for the release.

  The tag name must match the version number prefixed by a "v" (for example,
  version 3.2.1 would be tagged v3.2.1).

  The tag must be pushed to ${REMOTE} before the release can be published.

  Additional args after <version> will be passed to "npm publish" (e.g. "--tag beta").
